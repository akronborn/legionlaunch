Launch page for Tri-Legion Study Platform: February 2020.

The Launch page allows users to sign up to receive an email when the site is launched and displays a running tally of the number of users who have signed up thus far. 

A PDF image of the site is provided in the Public folder.

The Tri-Legion launch page was built with Node, Express, EJS, and MySQL. 

Disclaimers: I am a back-end programming working toward improving my css skills, and have chosen to discontinue the use of Bootstrap in 2020. It's rough, but it's the only way to get better. 

CSS files are normally kept in the public folder, however, due to an internal issue, css has been included in the ejs file.
